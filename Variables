A VARIABLE is a name given to a memory location inside our computer where we can store data
EXAMPLE:
int age;
here "int" is a Keyword and "age" is a variable name
int is a integer data type
; -> semicolen is used at the end of every line which indicates the end of the statement line.
NOW Let's an example

INPUT

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int age = 25;
printf("C-Porgraming");
printf(" %d",age);
return 0;
}

Notice here %d is a format specifier for integer

OUTPUT

C-Porgraming 25
